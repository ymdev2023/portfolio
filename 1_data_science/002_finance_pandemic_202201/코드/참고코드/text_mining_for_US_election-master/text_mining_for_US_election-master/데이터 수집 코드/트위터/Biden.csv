Congratulations to the UN World Food Program. With global hunger on the march, made worse by the pandemic and conflict around the world, we must come together to fight food insecurity. As president, I'll support the WFP and reassert American leadership to address global hunger.

When President Trump was told one thousand Americans were dying every day from COVID-19, he shrugged it off and said, ""it is what it is.""

It is what it is?

This president doesn't even pretend to care about the Americans he swore to serve. It's disgraceful.

One in five small businesses have closed.
More than 25 million Americans are on unemployment.
Millions are at risk of losing their homes.

But President Trump doesn’t seem to care. He only cares about how he and his wealthy friends are doing.

The fact is this pandemic has exposed the cracks in our already broken mental health care system.

We can and must do better.

As president, I’ll fight to achieve mental health parity, expand access to care, and wipe out the stigma. #WorldMentalHealthDay

When President Trump was told one thousand Americans were dying every day from COVID-19, he shrugged it off and said, ""it is what it is.""

It is what it is?

This president doesn't even pretend to care about the Americans he swore to serve. It's disgraceful.

- Millions of new, good-paying jobs
- A $15 federal minimum wage
- Stronger benefits and fair workplaces
- An economy that works for everyone—not just the wealthy

What does building back better mean for you?

- Millions of new, good-paying jobs
- A $15 federal minimum wage
- Stronger benefits and fair workplaces
- An economy that works for everyone—not just the wealthy
- The choice to join a union

That's the future we can build together.

In the middle of a pandemic, President Trump is trying to eliminate Obamacare and increase health care costs for millions.

Now, he’s rushing through a U.S. Supreme Court justice to help him get it done. It’s unconscionable. 

Make no mistake: Health care is on the ballot.

What does building back better mean for you?

- Millions of new, good-paying jobs
- A $15 federal minimum wage
- Stronger benefits and fair workplaces
- An economy that works for everyone—not just the wealthy
- The choice to join a union

That's the future we can build together.

In the middle of a pandemic, President Trump is trying to eliminate Obamacare and increase health care costs for millions.

Now, he’s rushing through a U.S. Supreme Court justice to help him get it done. It’s unconscionable. 

Make no mistake: Health care is on the ballot.

What does building back better mean for you?

- Millions of new, good-paying jobs
- A $15 federal minimum wage
- Stronger benefits and fair workplaces
- An economy that works for everyone—not just the wealthy
- The choice to join a union

That's the future we can build together.

I do. I'll get America back to work — and build back better.

When President Trump was told one thousand Americans were dying every day from COVID-19, he shrugged it off and said, ""it is what it is.""

It is what it is?

This president doesn't even pretend to care about the Americans he swore to serve. It's disgraceful.

Here’s how we’ll do it:
